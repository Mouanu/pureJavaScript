üó£Ô∏è "How does a JavaScript file run and execute?"

"When a JavaScript file runs, the JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome or Node.js) creates a Global Execution Context. Execution happens in two phases: first, the Memory Creation Phase, and then the Code Execution Phase."

üîπ Step-by-Step Breakdown (use this structure):
Global Execution Context (GEC) is created

JS sets up the global environment

this and global object (window or global) are initialized

Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting Phase)

Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized to undefined

let and const are hoisted too but remain uninitialized (in Temporal Dead Zone)

Function declarations are hoisted fully

this and arguments (for function ECs) are set

Code Execution Phase

JS runs the code line-by-line

Variables get actual values

Functions are invoked ‚Üí each creates a new Function Execution Context

These ECs are managed using the Call Stack

Call Stack

Keeps track of execution contexts

GEC goes at the bottom, function ECs stack on top

When a function finishes, its EC is popped off the stack

üîö Final line for impact:
"So basically, JS runs by creating execution contexts and managing them through the call stack, processing memory first and then code ‚Äî that's how every JS file executes."
